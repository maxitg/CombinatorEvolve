SetUsage @ "
FileTreeHashes['path$', pattern$, depth$, excludeList$] returns a list of pairs consisting of {'filename', hash}.
* The files found are those matching pattern$ that are within 'path$'.
* The file pattern pattern$ is as used by FileNames, and can be a list.
* depth$ instructs FileTreeHash how many directories to preserve from the returned absolute paths to ensure they
are independent of the overall location of a file tree on disk.
* excludeList$ can contain a list of file names to exclude.
